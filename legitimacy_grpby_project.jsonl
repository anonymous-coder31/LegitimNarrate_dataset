You have probably noticed in the presentation video that we already have two functional Pulsar prototypes.","The development phase is though almost over, but at this moment we clearly miss something essential : user feedback.","That's why we decided to create this KickStarter campaign.","It's not a way to commercialize our product, but clearly a way to finalize its development before launching it on the market.","We strongly hope that it will be a way a start this great and wonderful adventure with you.","The HyperNova 3D team","Update 4, focus on the hotends : During the development process, we had some discussions about the choice of the hotends.","After having performed many tests, we decided to use a generic material with some adaptations, because it perfectly fits our design and offers some functionnalities which are essential for us, like : The possibility of using a cartdrige thermistor; The capability to easily adjust the height of the nozzle (mandatory to allow dual head prints) thanks to an unthreaded throat sustained by a screw; The insurance of a continuous guidance of the filament thanks to a full 4.1mm bore throat, allowing a direct contact between the PTFE and the nozzle which prevents jamming and clogging issues.","On the top of that, we integrated a little electronic card equipped with connectors on the printing head, and adapted the wires of the heating cartridge and of the thermistor to allow an easy replacement.","And last but not least, the fully equiped hotends will be available as spare parts at the production price (~10-15\u20ac).","So in case of clogging, jamming or breakage, and because we adress our printer for people who don't want to achieve complex operations to maintain it, the only needed operation will consist in replacing the entire hotend at an affordable price.","Here are some detailed pictures of the hotends :  ","Update 3, printed parts examples: Here are some examples of printed parts.","If someone wants to see a specific make, please contact us in private message.","The classical benchy","Articulated snake","Articulated T-Rex ","An hybrid PLA \/ TPU wheel for RC car ","Spiral vases printed in duplication mode","Update 2, bed leveling test : Our printer uses the unified bed leveling feature.","As a consequence, as long as no modification is made to the level adjustment of the printing surface (thanks to the screws in the corners for example), the bed leveling has to be performed only once, and not before each printing process.","We've worked hard to make this functionnality as efficient and precise as possible by tuning the firmware and the sensing devices, and here is the result: ","Bed leveling test performed on the first prototype","This is what we call a good first layer !","Bed leveling test performed on the second prototype","As we noticed that it was a good way to test the limits of our printer, we decided to perform the official Kickstarter torture test !","You can find its description and the stl file use by following this link","After some fine tuning made in our slicing profile, we are proud to tell you that we succeeded in reaching almost a perfect score : 29\/30","Here are the detailed results :","And some pictures of the test print :  ","This test was performed at a printing speed of 50mm\/s, but afterwards, we tried to repeat it at differents speeds to see the influence of this parameter.","At low speed (25mm\/s), the negative feature resolution is clearly better as it was possible to remove all the pins, but the drawback is that the quality of the spires on the top is worse (no strings, but the precision seems reduced on the highest part, probably because the hotend is staying longer on each spire).","At high speed (120mm\/s), the main drawbacks are that the negative feature is lower (3 pins removed) and that some ringing appeared on the sides of the piece.","The genesis of the project : We can assume it without any doubt: 3D printing can be considered as a real revolution which have spread all over the world, offering limitless possibilities for creating objects.","If you ask anyone if he knows it, he will for sure draw the main lines of this incredible process, even if he has never experienced it.","Although, even if many manufacturers have entered the game along these last years, a problem is still faced by many users.","In most cases, the printers designed for a personal use are pretty difficult to use, and necessitate some basic knowledge from the user to work correctly.","Professional printers offer better possibilities, but their level of price is definitely too high to be purchased by an individual, and are even not affordable for small companies.","Considering that this situation was no longer acceptable, we decided to create HyperNova 3D in 2018 with an ambitious long term goal : creating a real plug-and-print device, as easy to use as an inkjet printer, and at a level of price which allows anyone who is ready to invest in a premium device or any company to use it.","The team : HyperNova 3D was born in 2018 in the East of France, and was founded by five passionate associates : three technical engineers and two entrepreneurs who decided to work together to achieve this incredible project.","Each one in the team has a specific expertise, but we definitely put in application the agile method to ensure that it would lead to the success.","No project manager, no boss : only a team spirit which motivates us and push everyone to surpass himself.","The result: a high-end made-in-France printer. Beyond the ease of use of our printer, we wanted to ensure that it will be a powerful tool.","So first of all, the building volume was considered to be as large as possible but keeping in mind that because the printer was destined to be use as well by individual on their desktop or companies.","As a consequence, the final building volume is based a on a A3 sheet with a 200mm  high elevation.","(Prototype height, but might reach 230mm on the final version)","As this process is the cheapest and the most tried, we decided to choose the FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling) technology.","Classical yes, not a revolution, but with some additional features which make our printer a powerful machine.","We equipped it with a system of dual independent extruders, allowing incredible and time saving features.","Possibilities are numerous and everyone will find what he needs to face any situation : Single print with one filament at once ; Dual print of one piece with two different filaments (for instance : two colors, or one classical filament to print the piece and one soluble filament to print support structures) ; Duplication mode which allows to print the same piece twice at the same time ; Mirror mode which allows to print a piece and its mirrored version at the same time","To ensure a maximum accuracy and a long lasting reliability, we used a combination of strong and well tried components.","Though, the printer frame is made of steel and aluminium bent sheets produced in France, and the design has been thought to permit an intensive use without losing any precision.","In addition to that, and because it can become a plague, we put many efforts to limit noise emissions of our machine, even if some sources are impossible to suppress, like the fans which are necessary to get high quality prints.","Cherry on the cake, and because we are convinced that this is a guarantee of quality, our printer will be assembled in France.","Intuitive an use friendly : As one of our goals was to create a real plug-and-print device, usable by anyone even without any basic technical background, we have decided to base our HMI (Human-Machine Interface) on Astroprint, through a 7 inches touchscreen mounted on the front panel.","Astroprint, which includes a cloud-based slicing solution, offers a clear an intuitive an user-friendly interface.","It requiress an internet connection to work, which is made possible thanks to a Raspberry Pi.","In addition to the touchscreen, Astroprint offers the possibility to control the printer through a web browser or a dedicated smartphone application.","It also integrates 3D objects research features, linked with Thingiverse and MyMiniFactory.","On the top of this interface, we worked hard to ensure that no manual calibration performed directly by the user was needed.","As a consequence, we succeeded to create automatic calibration processes which can be called thanks to step-by-step illustrated wizards, displayed on the printer itself.","Some additional wizards were also created to make the usual maintenance operations as easy as possible to perform, like changing a filament spool or cleaning the nozzles.","Sfety first : Of course even if precision and reliability are essential, safety was definitely the main point in each step of the development of the printer.","We applied the main applicable standards which are the following : Machinery Directive (2006\/42\/CE);

what we want the guitar ecosystem to be, from more transportable and functional instruments, to bold, fresh and modern designs with expanded expressive abilities.","We aim to continue the guitar legacy with the means of today.","The founding team : Our team is made of music lovers and forward thinking guitarists, skilled engineers and designers.","We are working closely with guitarists of all origins and stories as well as other guitar or audio brands to deliver the best quality instruments for you.","The story behind the slite : We imagined the Slite about six years ago to fulfill the personal need of transporting a working guitar everywhere everyday.","We wanted to do things differently and more efficiently from what has already been done regarding folding guitars, short and ultra short scales, digital guitars and more, to expand the functionalities of the guitar even further, while making music creation more convenient.","From this, we developed our vision to bring this idea to you while combining it with other technologies to create an all-in-one guitar that can evolve with the development of its ecosystem.","The Slite can then become, more than any other guitar, a real tool for social interaction and spontaneous musical expression.","The first ever sketch of the Slite's design","Inspired by the most forward-thinking guitar builders of this time, Jens Ritter, Ulrich Teuffel, Relish Guitars, and many more, as well as french designer Philippe Starck, we designed the Slite with a plan to make absolutely no concession on the design and ergonomics to add functionalities to our beloved instrument.","After a trip to Hong Kong with the earliest prototype, the Slite\u2019s current and final design was born, borrowing lines from airplanes and minimalist electronics items along the way.","We met with the teams of several industry-leading guitar builders of this era to discuss what we want to achieve with the Slite.","From those inspiring encounters with likeminded people, we brought home a lot of great ideas to keep innovating on the Slite, and the certitude that we are going in the right direction with our guitar.","What's in the case ? The Slite's case is a bit more than your usual gig bag, as it plays a true role in the Slite's concept.","The case is both lightweight and strong, being made out of high resistance EVA foam, allowing you to carry your Slite everywhere with you without ever damaging it.","The latest case prototype  ","It can not only house every part of the Slite in the most compact configuration for a guitar, but also leaves enough room to carry an additional pickup set, several picks in a well-ordered fashion, the USB power cable and brick and even more, from a strap to a jack.","Rewards : For you to experience your Slite at its fullest when you will get it, we teamed up with the people at TrueFire to give you a 90 days All Access Pass to all their courses and a free course download (package value ~$120) for free with every pledge for a Slite.","TrueFire provides amazing online guitar lessons to guitarists of all skills level, with over 40,000 video guitars lessons at your disposal!","Available Packages : Here on Kickstarter we offer you two main packages to get your Slite: The base package contains everything you need to get playing everywhere quietly or on your favorite setup and at the best price!","You will be able to choose your pickup configuration from any combination of single coil and humbucker pickups.","The amp package contains every features of the base package, with the addition of the built-in amp& speakers in the top wing to play in full autonomy with all the possibilities offered by the Slite!","You will be able to choose your pickup configuration from any combination of single coil and humbucker pickups.","Add ons : In addition to the Slite package of your choosing, you can purchase any combination of the following add ons to expand your Slite's playability and your playing experience even further.","Just add the total amount for the add ons you want to your pledge, and we will send you a survey to confirm your choices!","You will have the choice between two effects modules: a low-gain one based on overdrive, reverb and tremolo, as well as a high-gain one based on distortion, fuzz and a preamp.","If you choose a new pickup set, you can choose any 2-pickups configuration you like between our single coil or humbucker pickups.","The effect loop module allows you to plug your usual effect pedals between the Slite's effects or controls and the headphone or speaker amp.","We need you : Over the last months we made amazing progress into making the Slite ready to be played by everyone, but we are not done yet, and you can hep us achieve this!","This campaign is one of the last steps into making this project real for everybody to enjoy, by allowing us to finish the development in the best possible conditions.","We want to put you in the center of the final development of the Slite to be able to create a premium and powerful instrument that would be the best fit for you.","Supporting this project means giving support to Reveho\u2019s team of engineers and musicians and believing in what we are aiming to achieve with this new take on your favorite instrument.","It will help us achieve our vision of modular and highly functional instrument along with the ecosystem we want to create, to enable playing with great ease and no compromise and to one day extend this line of products and make it available to anyone.","Stretch goeals : Help us reach our funding goal to discover what we are preparing next for you!","They talk about us : A few news outlets already noticed the potential of the Slite!","Special thanks.

neither do we want to wear a plastic-looking device to an elegant event.","we believe that wearables should seamlessly blend into our everyday lives, and that\u2019s exactly what circular does.","it\u2019s scratch-resistant, water-resistant, and you can switch up your style to fit the occasion with interchangeable outer shells.","need a charge? connect on-the-go with our mobile charging solution.","the circular ring connects via bluetooth to your iphone or android device.","setting up the ring is as easy as downloading the app onto your phone, and all software updates are wirelessly transmitted to your circular ring.","built-in intelligence : we designed circular to be an effortless, autonomous part of your daily life.","there's no on\/off button on the ring; it knows whether you are wearing it or not.","similarly, there's no need to notify the app nor the ring about what you are going to do.","circular knows when you go to sleep and when you do activities, and it uploads the subsequent data to your phone automatically.","if your phone is not available, it can collect and store detailed data for up to 7 days.","body signal processing  : the ring collects the body signals it needs using its dual sensors (heart rate sensor and accelerometer).","circular contains a built-in processor that will process the data and send it by bluetooth to the circular mobile app for analysis.","the circular app uses machine learning to better understand your habits and offer a personalized experience.","wave free during your sleep : although the 2400 mhz to 2485 mhz radiation output of a bluetooth device is negligible to your health, the circular ring automatically goes into \u201csleep mode\u201d when it detects a sleeping state\u2060\u2014meaning that it is functioning without bluetooth during your sleep while still capturing your body signals.","it will synchronize with the app when you get up.","the sensors : a precise 3 axis accelerometer ; a red and infrared optical pulse sensor","having infrared leds means that there are no blinking lights on the ring to disturb your sleep because our eyes cannot see infrared wavelengths of light.","using circular is simple (so simple you basically don\u2019t have to do anything).","here\u2019s how it works","here\u2019s what our beta testers have to say about the circular experience","we think that wearables on the market are bulky, and most of them are gadget-looking.","because of that, we can\u2019t wear our wearables at any moment.","watches and bands are uncomfortable at night, so we don\u2019t like to sleep with them.","moreover, we don\u2019t want to wear our plastic-made or bulky wearables at an elegant event or meeting.","because we don\u2019t wear our wearables enough, the data can\u2019t be used for advanced correlations.","this leads to poor user results and low material benefits that make us tire quickly of our wearables experience.","regarding the data, the output data is frequently either inaccurate or isn\u2019t useful because the recommendations are not personalized.","despite abandoning our wellness wearables, we still loved the benefits we were promised; and that\u2019s how circular was born.","we\u2019re taking wearable devices to a whole new level because we really believe in the power of assisted technology.","we've developed a wearable that can truly be worn 24\/7 without affecting our comfort or our look, and that will allow for advanced personalized recommendations.","by cross-analyzing your data day and night while taking into consideration your own personal history and habits, we are able to deliver a truly personal experience and not simply hand out raw data.","it\u2019s wellness, evolved.","we\u2019re a diverse group of individuals with a shared passion for innovation.","our big \u201cthing\u201d is making sense of data to allow people to live to their fullest.","our vision has led us all to embark on this crazy journey\u2014combining the greatest tech of the past years to create a new generation of intuitive wearables.","imagine combining the power of ai, big data, miniaturization, and iot together; that\u2019s our goal.","let\u2019s leap into the future together.","circular is a vision we\u2019ve been dying to bring to life since 2017.","the product you\u2019re seeing in this project is the result of innumerable hours of iterating and reiterating.","we\u2019re perfectionists, and we wanted to make sure circular could do it all\u2014without creating a product that would fall into the abyss a few months later.","with your help, we can make the final leap.","let\u2019s be honest with you; hardware is hard.","we\u2019re still a small company battling some of the largest competitors in the world.","we believe that this is the best and most efficient way for us to get our product to open-minded and technology-enthusiastic people that can understand it before everyone else.","circular needs your help to fully come to life.","prototypes and pre-production units were mostly financed personally and with the help of public institutions and contests we have won.","but we now face high upfront expenses regarding tooling, certifications, and minimum quantity purchases.","our trusted manufacturing partners need a minimum financial commitment from us to get started on a larger manufacturing run.","with kickstarter, we would be able to put in a larger order with our manufacturing partners enabling us to serve the exact customer demand.","guess what?
